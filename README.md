This website is about a hypothetical yoga studio

## User stories

AS A health-conscious person (Who?)
I WANT TO access description of classes (What?)
SO THAT I can decide which one helps keep me healthy (Why?)

AS A person with a busy lifestyle who wants to do yoga
I WANT TO know information about yoga retreats
SO THAT I can enjoy a get away to reset my mind

AS A person who practices yoga
I WANT TO know where the yoga studio location is
SO THAT I can attend yoga classes local to me


## Typical mistakes when writing user stories

1. Performing multiple actions in one user story (e.g. I want to visit a yoga studio and I want to sign up for a yearly membership and I want to take classes there and I want to know what kind of classes I can choose from. - these are 4 different user stories)
2. Using technical terms that imply a certain way of implementation (e.g. button clicks, website browsing, submitting an online form). User stories are meant to be written without developer jargon. Reason: maybe the user's pain points or desires can be addressed offline.
3. Writting "As a User" without specifying what kind of user. Very common product, many product managers mess this up. Select a well described user persona instead.
